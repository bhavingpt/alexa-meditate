#Alexa Guru

![Background](/webapp/static/background.jpg)

A personal yogi to guide you through your daily meditation. 

Built with Amazon Web Services, Amazon's Alexa/Echo, Python (Flask), and good ol' Javascript (client and server side) at MHacks 8. 

## Inspiration

When I was a kid my family would take me to traditional Indian events and we would be led in meditation by our local guru. I was a carefree kid though, so I unfortunately didn't pay much attention. Now, however, I wish I could go back to those simpler times and be led in a guided meditation more often.

## What it does

With that in mind, we trained Alexa in a new skill: being a guru! She is now capable of leading three types of meditation sessions for anywhere between 1 to 10 minutes. Simply get started by saying `alexa meditate` and she will guide you in the greatest journey you'll ever take sitting down. 

We also keep track of your meditation sessions! Alexa Guru tracks your sessions and information about how well it went, all of which you can visualize on the website.
